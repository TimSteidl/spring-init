# Spring init

run with **npx spring-init@latest** + options

### Options:

**create** - start the initialisation process
Current options under create: - Class only - Dependency injection - Crud operations

#### For the Crud operations you can now also choose which endpoints to generate:

GET, GET-BY-ID, POST, PUT, DELETE

### Targets:

- Automate reocurrances in the initial stage of configuring a spring application
  This encompasses the generation of:
  - Packages
  - Entitys
  - Controllers
  - Services
  - CRUD Operations
  - Jpa Repositories

The common destinguishing difference when first building the project is usually just the name of the entity,
which defines the package name, controller name, service name and repository name.
